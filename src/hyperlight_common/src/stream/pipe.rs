//! Byte pipes, the state behind each stream.
//!
//! A stream's writer and reader share one pipe. It holds the bytes written and not read. Its
//! capacity bounds them, so a fast writer waits for a slow reader.
//!
//! # Moving the reader
//!
//! A stream starts with both ends on one side, joined by its pipe. The reader can move to the
//! other side as a call argument or result. Bytes it left unread stay in the pipe. The `Mux` reads
//! the pipe in the reader's place and sends its bytes across. The other side writes them into a
//! second pipe that the moved reader reads.
//!
//! An end the `Mux` holds is remote. Progress at the other end rings the session's [`Doorbell`],
//! so the `Mux` learns of bytes to send, bytes read, and closes.
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! Waking a task or dropping a waker can run code that reenters a pipe. [`Deferred`] holds that
//! work until the pipe lock is released.
