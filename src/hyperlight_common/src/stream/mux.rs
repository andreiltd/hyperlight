//! The stream multiplexer of one session.
//!
//! [`Mux`] prepares outgoing reader transfers and stream records. The transport publishes them,
//! then commits their effects here. Incoming transfers yield readers. Incoming records update
//! pipes and stream state. `Mux` performs no I/O.
//!
//! # Entries
//!
//! A reader moves to the peer in a function call or result. Its stream then has an entry on each
//! side:
//!
//! - A [`SendStream`] at its origin, the writer's side. Its pipe retains uncredited bytes.
//! - A [`RecvStream`] on the reader's side. Received DATA fills a second pipe that the reader
//!   reads.
//!
//! A trip runs from a reader leaving its origin until it returns or closes. Each trip has a fresh
//! sid from the origin, and entry counters count bytes from its start.
//!
//! # Returning readers
//!
//! A reader can return to its writer's side in another call or result. Its transfer carries the
//! trip's sid and its consumed byte position. The peer removes its receive entry after publishing
//! the return. The origin removes its send entry on receipt and makes the original reader local.
//!
//! The position accounts for reads whose CREDIT has not arrived. Reading resumes at the first
//! unread byte in the original pipe. DATA crossing the return is discarded at the peer.
//!
//! # Doorbell
//!
//! Handles leave the Mux work between its calls:
//!
//! - A send stream's writer leaves DATA or END to send when it writes, closes, or aborts.
//! - A receive stream's reader leaves CREDIT or CLOSE_READER to send when it reads or closes.
//!
//! Each rings the session's [`Doorbell`], which wakes the task driving the Mux. Mux calls leave
//! work too, such as DATA that a received CREDIT lets through, so the driver also checks for work
//! after them.
//!
//! # Untrusted input
//!
//! The host treats the guest's Stream messages and reader transfers as untrusted.
//! [`BatchDecoder`] checks individual records. [`Mux::recv_records`] checks stream state,
//! and [`Mux::recv_transfer`] checks reader transfers. A violation is a [`ProtocolError`].
//!
//! The checks also bound what the guest costs the host. Each record touches at most one stream
//! and copies at most a window. Each receive stream buffers at most a window, and a side has at
//! most [`MAX_STREAMS`] receive streams.
